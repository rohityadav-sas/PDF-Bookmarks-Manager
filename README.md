## Usage

Place the required files in the input folder:

- **PDF file**: The PDF file for which you want to edit metadata and create bookmarks.
- **metadata.json**: Contains metadata such as title, author, and subject for the PDF. The format is as follows:

  ```json
  {
  	"title": "Sample PDF",
  	"author": "John Doe",
  	"subject": "Sample Subject"
  }
  ```

- **bookmarks.json**: Defines the bookmarks hierarchy (title, page numbers, and parent-child relationships).

## Bookmarks Format Guide

### Explanation:

1. **index**: The title and starting page of the section, separated by a /. For example:

   - ```json
     "index": "Table of Contents/2"
     ```
     This means the section **Table of Contents** starts on page **2**.

2. **children**: Defines sub-sections or exercises under a parent bookmark.

   - ```json
     "Exercise 1/3"
     ```
     This indicates a bookmark titled **Exercise 1** starts on page **3**.

3. **Hierarchy**:

   - Parent bookmarks contain a children array with their sub-bookmarks.
   - Sub-bookmarks within a child (level 3 or deeper) are not currently supported.

### File Structure:

```json
[
	{
		"index": "Table of Contents/2"
	},
	{
		"index": "Complex Analysis/2",
		"children": [
			"Exercise 1/3",
			"Exercise 2/6",
			"Exercise 3/11",
			"Exercise 4/17"
		]
	},
	{
		"index": "The Z-Transform/51",
		"children": [
			"Exercise 5/43",
			"Exercise 6/52",
			"Exercise 7/70",
			"Exercise 8/85"
		]
	},
	{
		"index": "Partial Differential Equation/108",
		"children": [
			"Exercise 9/113",
			"Exercise 10/119",
			"Exercise 11/126",
			"Exercise 12/136"
		]
	}
]
